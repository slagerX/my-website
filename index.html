                <p>"There is no end to education. It is not that you read a book, pass an examination, and finish with education. The whole of life, from the moment you are born to the moment you die, is a process of learning."</p>

            <h3>A few words about me</h3>
            <p>Until now, in my life, I have an active lifestyle—newly active moments full of variety, challenges, and improvements. It is difficult for me to stay in one place for a long time need to go outside. I consider myself a respectful, open-minded, and honest person. I really enjoy learning, and experiences from around the world.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Philosophy</h3>
            <p>I believe in ethics and moral—not in imposed rules that you "have to" follow. I believe life is made of different shades of gray, not just black and white. Furthermore, as rational human beings, I think it is our duty to take care of the world and treat others as we would like to be treated. This perspective shapes my beliefs and behavior. Summarizing in several points:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Honest</li>
                <li>Respectful</li>
                <li>Open-minded</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Interests & Hobbies</h3>
            <p>I'm passionate about technology and human behavior—both influence all my interests and hobbies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Visiting new places</li>
                <li>Having new experiences</li>
